"""
Modifies the file to comply (as much as possible) with the format specifications.

This includes:
    - Adding TER statements after chain breaks/changes
    - Truncating/Padding all lines to 80 characters
    - Adds END statement at the end of the file

This will remove all original TER/END statements from the file.

Usage:
    python pdb_tidy.py <pdb file>

Example:
    python pdb_tidy.py 1CTF.pdb

This program is part of the `pdb-tools` suite of utilities and should not be
distributed isolatedly. The `pdb-tools` were created to quickly manipulate PDB
files using the terminal, and can be used sequentially, with one tool streaming
data to another. They are based on old FORTRAN77 code that was taking too much
effort to maintain and compile. RIP.
